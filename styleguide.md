###Bureaucratese
- active voice should be standard (unless there's a good reason for passive)
- consistent tense
- avoid words "focusing on", "helping to"-just pick one verb!

### Measurements
- abbreviations for km, m
- no space between abbrev and # (e.g. 12,000km not 12,000 km)

### Abbrev.
- e.g. means "for example". If you list several examples, do not follow with "etc.", as it is implied.
- i.e. means "as in". Give the essence of the thing you are explaining. 

###Spelling 
- Use standard Canadian spellings (ensure language is properly set within InDesign)
